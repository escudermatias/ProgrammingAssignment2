## makeCacheMatrix creates a special "matrix", which is really a list containing a function to

## 1. set the value of the matrix
## 2. get the value of the matrix
## 3. set the value of the matrix's inverse
## 4. get the value of the matrix's inverse

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## Write a short comment describing this function

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
